Class:

Attributes:

aroma = ('string')

Methods:

addFruit (change the aroma given off due to adding fruit contents)
addIce (change the alcoholPercentage because it will be diluted from the melting ice)
chillFirst (change the temperature of the wine so servedRoomTemp becomes false if was true)
recork (change the screwTop to false because we put a cork in it since we lost the top somehow)
